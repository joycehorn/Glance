# Glance

I had a 2nd Generation iPad collecting dust so I decided to turn it into a personal information board that I keep in the kitchen. It displays the current time, date, weather, and a todo list! The app is built with **React Native & Expo** and the todo list is hosted on **Firebase**.

### Setup

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rosswaycaster/Glance.git
$ cd Glance
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
